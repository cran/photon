This vignette is an introduction to the `{photon}` package, an interface to the [photon](https://photon.komoot.io/) geocoder developed by [komoot](https://www.komoot.com/). Photon is open-source, based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, and powered by the [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) search engine. It is -- according to komoot -- fast, scalable, multilingual, typo-tolerant, and up-to-date. Photon can do unstructured geocoding, reverse geocoding, and (under special circumstances) structured geocoding. Komoot offers a public photon API (https://photon.komoot.io/) but you can also set up a photon instance on a local machine.

`{photon}` supports both online and offline geocoding. Online geocoding through komoots public API is intriguing because it is convenient and offers up-to-date global coverage. It is appropriately easy to use online geocoding in `{photon}`. First, it is necessary to tell R that you want to use the public API. This can be done using the workhorse function `new_photon()`. To set up online geocoding, simply call it without parameters:

```{r public_api, eval=FALSE}
new_photon()
#> <photon>
#>   Type   : remote
#>   Server : https://photon.komoot.io/
```

The created `photon` object is attached to the session and does not have to be stored manually. Now you can geocode.

```{r geocode, eval=FALSE}
cities1 <- geocode(c("Sanaa", "Caracas"), osm_tag = ":city")
cities1
#> Simple feature collection with 2 features and 12 fields
#> Geometry type: POINT
#> Dimension:     XY
#> Bounding box:  xmin: -66.9146 ymin: 10.50609 xmax: 44.20588 ymax: 15.35386
#> Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84
#> # A tibble: 2 × 13
#>     idx osm_type    osm_id osm_key osm_value type   countrycode name  country state county extent            geometry
#>   <int> <chr>        <int> <chr>   <chr>     <chr>  <chr>       <chr> <chr>   <chr> <chr>  <list>         <POINT [°]>
#> 1     1 N        258013552 place   city      distr… YE          Sana… Yemen   Aman… At Ta… <lgl>  (44.20588 15.35386)
#> 2     2 R         11219583 place   city      city   VE          Cara… Venezu… Capi… Munic… <dbl>  (-66.9146 10.50609)
```

Similarly, you can also reverse geocode. `{photon}` fully supports `sf` objects so that all geocoding functions return `sf` dataframes and `reverse()` accepts `sf` and `sfc` objects as input.

```{r reverse, eval=FALSE}
cities2 <- reverse(cities1, osm_tag = ":city")
cities2
#> Simple feature collection with 2 features and 12 fields
#> Geometry type: POINT
#> Dimension:     XY
#> Bounding box:  xmin: -66.9146 ymin: 10.50609 xmax: 44.20588 ymax: 15.35386
#> Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84
#> # A tibble: 2 × 13
#>    idx osm_type    osm_id osm_key osm_value type   countrycode name  country state county extent            geometry
#>  <int> <chr>        <int> <chr>   <chr>     <chr>  <chr>       <chr> <chr>   <chr> <chr>  <list>         <POINT [°]>
#>1     1 N        258013552 place   city      distr… YE          Sana… Yemen   Aman… At Ta… <lgl>  (44.20588 15.35386)
#>2     2 R         11219583 place   city      city   VE          Cara… Venezu… Capi… Munic… <dbl>  (-66.9146 10.50609) 
```

```{r compare, eval=FALSE}
all.equal(cities1, cities2)
#> [1] TRUE
```


Online geocoding is nice and it is most likely what you need for basic tasks. But what if online geocoding is not enough? What if you need to geocode a dataset of 200,000 places? What if you need to geocode sensitive information from survey respondents? And what about structured geocoding?


# Offline geocoding

The photon backend is freely available on the [photon GitHub repository](https://github.com/komoot/photon). With it, you can set up a local instance of photon. Offline geocoding is nice because it is extremely fast, versatile and it doesn't send your potentially sensitive data around the internet. In a lot of cases, offline geocoding is absolutely imperative, yet usually, setting up an offline geocoder can be quite cumbersome. `{photon}` takes over this task!

To run photon, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher. To do that, you can use the [`{rJavaEnv}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJavaEnv) package by Egor Kotov. It allows you to easily set up a JDK environment for a local project.

```{r java, eval=FALSE}
# pak::pkg_install("rJavaEnv")
library(rJavaEnv)

# Consent to downloading Java
rje_consent()
#> Consent for using rJavaEnv has already been provided.

# Install and use Corretto JDK 24
use_java(24)

# Check if installation was successful
java_check_version_cmd()
#> JAVA_HOME: /root/.cache/R/rJavaEnv/installed/linux/x64/24
#> Java path: /root/.cache/R/rJavaEnv/installed/linux/x64/24/bin/java
#> Java version: "openjdk version \"24.0.1\" 2025-04-15 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-24.0.1.9.1 (build
#> 24.0.1+9-FR) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-24.0.1.9.1 (build 24.0.1+9-FR, mixed mode, sharing)"
#> [1] "24"
```



Setting up local photon also works through `new_photon()`. This time, we pass a path where the necessary files should be stored and a country for which a search index should be downloaded. While global coverage is also possible, the global search index is extremely large (around 80 GB). By default, `new_photon()` downloads a search index tagged with `latest` but it is also possible to query a search index created at a specific date.

```{r local_photon, eval=FALSE}
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "photon")
photon <- new_photon(path, country = "Monaco")
#> ℹ openjdk version "24.0.1" 2025-04-15
#> ℹ OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-24.0.1.9.1 (build 24.0.1+9-FR)
#> ℹ OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-24.0.1.9.1 (build 24.0.1+9-FR, mixed mode, sharing)
#> ✔ Successfully downloaded OpenSearch photon 0.7.0. [17.9s]
#> ✔ Successfully downloaded search index. [854ms]
#> • Version: 0.7.4
#> • Coverage: Monaco
#> • Time: 2025-09-17
```

The resulting object is an R6 class with a few methods to control the instance. To start photon, run `$start()`. This starts an external java process which can be accessed using the `$proc` attribute.

```{r start, eval=FALSE}
photon$start()

```

To check if the service is up and running, you can use `$is_ready()`.

```{r is_ready, eval=FALSE}
photon$is_ready()
#> [1] TRUE
```

Finally, to properly stop photon after you used it, you can run `$stop()`. You do not actually _need_ to run it manually, because it is (implicitly) executed on two occasions: 1. on garbage collection and 2. when the R session ends and external processes are killed.

```{r stop, eval=FALSE}
photon$stop()
```

To compare offline and online geocoding, let's benchmark them by geocoding the Samoan capital Apia:

```{r benchmark1, eval=FALSE}
# offline geocoding
bench::mark(with_photon(photon, geocode("Monte Carlo")), iterations = 25)$median
#> [1] 17.1ms
```

```{r benchmark2, eval=FALSE}
# online geocoding
photon_pub <- new_photon(mount = FALSE)
bench::mark(with_photon(photon_pub, geocode("Monte Carlo")), iterations = 25)$median
#> [1] 1.04s
```

That is a speed increase by a factor of almost 60 (and possibly more on faster machines)!

Finally, to clean up photon, i.e. stop the instance and delete the photon directory, run `$purge()`.

```{r purge, eval=FALSE}
photon$purge()
#> ℹ Purging an instance kills the photon process and removes the photon directory.
#> Continue? (y/N/Cancel) y
```
